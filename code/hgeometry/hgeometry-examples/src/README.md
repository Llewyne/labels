Examples
========

Some example applications that use HGeometry in its implementation. Most of
these examples are based on problems that appeared at the BAPC: the BeNeLux
Algorithms and Programming Competition. See For example the
[http://2014.bapc.eu/](BAPC 2014 website). These examples double as testcases.

Here is a list of the examples, and the algorithms/parts of HGeometry that they
showcase.

* ArmyBase: ConvexHull
* Gunslinger: ConvexHull
