\section{Literature}
\subsection{On (solving) Nonograms}
It is neccesary to describe what nonograms are, specifically the new types of nonograms (curved and sloped) that require automatic labeling. If removing labels is allowed in order to reach a solution, then we must also include an accurate algorithm to determine if the puzzle is still solvable. Otherwise we can assume the initial puzzle and set of descriptions is simple and solvable.\\
\subsubsection{Improved Automatic Generation of Curved Nonograms \cite{van2017improved}}
Outlines an algorithm for generating curved nonograms. Does not mention labeling.

\subsubsection{Design and automated generation of Japanese picture puzzles \cite{van2019design}}
Automated generation of regular, tangram (lines have one of four set orientations) and curved nonograms.  Does not mention label placement, only that labels can be omitted to increase the difficulty of the puzzle.

\subsubsection{The concept and automatic generation of the Curved Nonogram puzzle \cite{de2016concept}}
Automated generation of curved nonograms. Also goes into aesthetics. No mention of label placement.

\subsubsection{Automated generation and visualization of picture-logic puzzles \cite{ortiz2007automated}}
Generation of regular nonograms, in black and white and color. \\

\subsubsection{Solving Japanese Puzzles with Heuristics \cite{salcedo2007solving}}
Solving of regular nonograms, in black and white and color.\\

\subsection{On (solving) puzzles in general}

\subsubsection{Quantifying over play: Constraining undesirable solutions in puzzle design \cite{smith2013quantifying}}
Describes an algorithm for automatically generating levels with no undesirable solutions for a specific puzzle game.

\subsubsection{The Connect-The-Dots family of puzzles: design and automatic generation \cite{loffler2014connect}}
Generation of Connect-The-Dots puzzles and three new puzzle types: Connect-The-Closest-Dot, Connect-That-Dot (connect to dot in that direction), Connect-The-Unit-Dots (connect dots that lie at a unit distance)

\subsection{On labeling}
Labeling nonograms is similar to labeling graphs. Therefore research on automatically labeling graph boundaries is helpful.\\

\subsection{On graph/puzzle aesthetics}
At minimum, the goal is to design an algorithm that can determine a labeling where all labels are included and non of the labels overlap, if such a labeling exists. We can apply additional restrictions in order to reach a solution that is also aesthetically pleasing. In order to do this we must first determine what is aesthetically pleasing.\\

\subsubsection{Validating Graph Drawing Aesthetics \cite{purchase1995validating}}
An empirical study on three measurable aesthetic qualities of graphs. These aesthetics are symmetry, minimize edge crossings and minimize bends. Only the first applies to this project, as we already assume that edge crossings and bends will reduce the understandability of a labeling, and therefore will only consider labelings without edge crossings and bends. Unfortunately the results regarding symmetry in this study are inconclusive. However, the authors do provide some ideas on how to perform a conclusive study of the symmetrical aesthetic.\\

\subsubsection{Metrics for Graph Drawing Aesthetics \cite{purchase2002metrics}}
This paper presents metrics for measuring the aesthetic presence in a graph drawing for seven common aesthetic criteria. While none of the metrics except "maximizing symmetry" could apply to the problem of labeling, the general ideas concerning how to choose and use are still relevant. The paper proposes that measures should be continuous rather than binary. This is also true for puzzle labeling. Assuming we have a set of measurable aesthetic criteria, we can design an algorithm that minimizes or maximizes these aspects of the labeling.\\

Only focusses on different ways of drawing leaders \textit{inside} the boundary and is therefore not really relevant.
